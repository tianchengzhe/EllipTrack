# EllipTrack

EllipTrack is a new global-local hybrid cell tracker optimized for tracking modern large-scale movies. The key innovation of EllipTrack is the introduction of a local track correction module, which systematically corrects the tracking mistakes of the global track linking algorithm from Magnusson and colleagues. Benchmark reveals that EllipTrack outperforms the existing state-of-the-art cell trackers and can identify nearly error-free cell lineages from multiple large-scale movies.
